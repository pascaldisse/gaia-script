# AI-Optimized Programming Language (AOPL) Specification

## Overview

AOPL is designed as an ultra-compact, symbolic programming language optimized for AI-to-AI communication with minimal token usage and maximum information density. This language prioritizes computational efficiency over human readability, leveraging specialized symbols to represent complex operations common in AI workloads.

## Core Design Principles

1. **Extreme Token Efficiency**: Each symbol or character represents a significant computational concept
2. **Pipeline-Oriented Syntax**: Data flows through operations using arrow notation
3. **Context-Aware Grammar**: Meaning of operators depends on position and surrounding context
4. **Implicit Parameters**: Default parameters are assumed when not explicitly specified
5. **AI Domain Specificity**: Built-in operations for common AI tasks (tensor operations, neural networks)

## Symbol Set and Basic Syntax

### Network Declaration

- `N`: Network declaration start
- `〈...〉`: Network components grouping

- `[...]×n`: Block repetition (repeat n times)

### Input/Output Operations

- `⊢`: Input specification marker
- `T`: Text input
- `I`: Image input
- `S`: Sequence input
- `Z`: Random/latent vector input
- `↵`: Return/output marker

### Data Flow

- `→`: Data flow operator (pipeline)
- `⊳`: Feeding output of one component to another
- `⟿`: Custom loss function marker

### Layers and Operations

- `C₁`, `C₂`: Convolutional layers with subscripts indicating layer number

### Normalization and Regularization

- `⊻`: Normalization flag
- `⊸`: Parameter declaration
- `μ`: Mean parameter
- `σ`: Standard deviation parameter
- `R`: Regularization (dropout or batch normalization)

### Parameters

- Numbers following operators specify dimensions, units, or sizes
- `n×n`: Indicates spatial dimensions
- `n×`: Indicates multiplication factor

### Special Operators

- `+`: Addition/concatenation
- `⊛`: Convolution operation
- `⊠`: Matrix multiplication
- `∇`: Gradient/derivative
- `⇝`: Custom operation defined by context
- `⇀`: Connect to
- `⍓`: Data preprocessing

## Data Types

Data types are mostly implicit but can be specified when necessary:

- Tensors: Default data structure, dimensions inferred from context
- Scalars: Simple numeric values
- Vectors: 1D tensors
- Matrices: 2D tensors

## Example Programs

### 1. CNN Image Classifier

```
N ⊻ I ⊸ μ σ → C₁ 32 5 ρ → R → P 2 → C₂ 64 3 ρ → R → P 2 → F → D₁ 128 R → D₀ 10 → S
```

### 2. Transformer for NLP

```
N ⊢ T ⇀ E 512 + P → [H 8 A → N → FF 2048 → D 0.1]×6 → PH → D₁ 1024 R → D₀ V → S
```

### 3. GAN Architecture

```
N〈G⊕D〉
G: Z 100 → U 4×4×512 → [U 2× → C 256 ρ]×2 → C 3 τ
D: I → [C 64 5 ρ → P 2]×3 → F → D₁ 1024 ρ → D₀ 1 σ
L: G(Z)⊳D⟿BCE+λ‖∇D‖
```

### 4. RNN with LSTM

```
N ⊢ S → E 256 → B 32 → [L 512]×2 → A → D₁ 128 ρ → D₀ C → S
```

### 5. AutoEncoder

```
N〈E⊕D〉
E: I → C₁ 32 3 ρ → P 2 → C₂ 64 3 ρ → P 2 → F → D₁ L ρ
D: L → D₁ 1024 ρ → R 8 8 64 → [T 3 64 ρ]×2 → C 3 σ
```

## Compilation Process

AOPL is designed to be compiled by a deterministic LLM specialized for interpreting this symbolic language and translating it directly to machine code. The language's extreme compactness minimizes token usage during the compilation process, allowing for efficient translation.

## Usage Guidelines

1. Networks always begin with `N` declaration
2. Data flows from left to right through arrow operators
3. Parameters following operators are positional and contextual
4. Component grouping is done with angle brackets or square brackets
5. Block repetition uses the `×n` notation
6. Loss functions are specified after the network architecture

## Extension Capabilities

The language is designed to be extended with additional symbols for specialized operations while maintaining its core design principles of compactness and efficiency.

## Implementation Notes

This language specification is designed for AI-to-AI communication and should be parsed by specialized compiler systems that understand the context-dependent nature of the symbols and can efficiently translate them to executable code.
