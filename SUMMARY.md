# GaiaScript Implementation Summary

## Completed Tasks

1. **Project Structure Setup**
   - Created Cargo project with appropriate dependencies
   - Organized code into modules for parser, AST, and interpreter

2. **Language Grammar Definition**
   - Implemented Pest grammar for AOPL syntax
   - Defined rules for all language components (networks, layers, data flow, etc.)
   - Created parsers for special characters and symbolic language elements

3. **Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)**
   - Defined comprehensive AST node types
   - Implemented display formatting for all node types
   - Created structures for networks, components, layers and operations

4. **Interpreter Implementation**
   - Created runtime environment and value representation
   - Implemented layer configuration and model building
   - Established tensor operations backbone using ndarray
   - Added error handling with custom error types

5. **Command Line Interface**
   - Built CLI with multiple commands using clap
   - Implemented parsing and execution subcommands
   - Added options for displaying AST or executing code

6. **Testing**
   - Added basic test cases for language parsing
   - Verified execution of minimal programs

## Future Development

1. **Grammar Improvements**
   - Refine grammar to handle more complex examples
   - Add better error reporting for syntax issues

2. **Feature Completion**
   - Implement full dataflow operations
   - Add support for complex network architectures (transformers, GANs)
   - Complete support for all activation functions and layer types

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Implement tensor operations optimizations
   - Add lazy evaluation for network execution

4. **Documentation and Examples**
   - Add more comprehensive examples
   - Create detailed documentation for language features
   - Add docstrings throughout the codebase

5. **Integration with ML Frameworks**
   - Add export capability to PyTorch/TensorFlow formats
   - Implement model serialization and deserialization
