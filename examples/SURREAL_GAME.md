# MorphSphere: A Surreal 3D AI Game

## Game Concept
MorphSphere is an abstract, surreal 3D environment where evolving entities called "Morphs" change their form based on interactions with the player and environment. The game uses neural networks to generate the visual aesthetics, entity behaviors, and dynamic soundscapes.

## Components (Defined in GaiaScript)

### World Generator (W)
```
W: I 64×64×3 → [C₁ 32 3 ρ → P 2]×2 → F → D₁ 512 → R 4×4×32 → U 2× → C 16 τ
```
This network takes a small seed image and generates the surreal 3D environment. It uses convolutional layers with pooling, followed by dense transformation and reshaping. The upsampling and hyperbolic tangent activation create smooth, flowing landscapes that morph over time.

### Agent Intelligence (A)
```
A: Z 100 → D₁ 256 ρ → D₁ 512 ρ → R 4×4×32
```
This network controls the autonomous Morphs that inhabit the world. It takes a latent vector (representing the Morph's "personality") and outputs behavior patterns. The ReLU activations create distinctive, non-linear behaviors.

### Player Perception (P)
```
P: I 128×128×3 → C₁ 64 5 ρ → P 2 → C₂ 128 3 ρ → P 2 → F → D₁ 512 → D₀ 3 σ
```
This network processes what the player sees and determines how the world responds to player actions. The sigmoid output layer creates smooth transitions between states.

## Gameplay Experience

In MorphSphere, players navigate a constantly evolving abstract 3D environment where geometric forms blend and transform. The autonomous Morphs react to the player's presence, either merging, splitting, or changing color based on proximity.

The player can:
1. Capture Morph essences to influence the environment
2. Merge with Morphs to gain new perception abilities
3. Create sound sculptures by manipulating the environment's geometry

There is no traditional "win" condition - the experience is about exploration and emergence. The neural networks continuously adapt, ensuring no two playthroughs are identical.

## Technical Implementation Notes

The complete implementation would require:
- Real-time 3D rendering engine
- Neural network inference for procedural generation
- Physics simulation for Morph interactions
- Procedural audio generation
- Player input processing

The GaiaScript notation provides a compact representation of the core neural architectures that would drive the game's unique aesthetic and behavior.
